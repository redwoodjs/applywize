# Applywize: A RedwoodSDK Tutorial Project

![Applywize Logo](./images-for-readme/README-HEADER.png)

## Overview

[Applywize](https://applywize.app) is a tutorial project designed to teach developers how to use [RedwoodSDK](https://rwsdk.com). Applywize is a practical job application tracking system that helps job seekers organize their job search process, manage applications, and track contacts.

This tutorial follows the principle of "tutorial-driven development" - we've designed the developer experience first, then built the code to support it. By completing this tutorial, you'll learn all the core features of RedwoodSDK while building a modern, useful application.

Applywize is a full-stack application that includes:

- User authentication and account management
- Job application tracking with status updates
- Contact management for networking
- Modern UI with TailwindCSS and ShadCN components
- Database integration with Prisma
- Deployment to Cloudflare

## How to Use This Repository

There are several ways to work through this tutorial:

1. [**Follow along step-by-step**](https://redwood-sdk-docs.pages.dev/tutorial/full-stack-app/setup/): Start from scratch and build the application as you progress through the tutorial.

2. **Use checkpoint references**: If you get stuck, refer to the `end-of-X` folders to see the completed code at the end of each lesson.

3. **Use the finished product**: The [`finished` folder](./finished) contains the complete, finished application with all features implemented.

4. **Design reference**: The [Figma files in the `figma` folder](./figma) provide the complete UI design if you want to match the intended look and feel.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, you should have:

- Basic knowledge of JavaScript, React, and modern web development
- Node.js and pnpm installed on your machine
- A code editor of your choice
- A [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com) account (for deployment)

## Getting Started

There are two ways to begin the tutorial:

### Option 1: Clone the entire repository

This will download all the files and folders to your computer.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/redwoodjs/applywize-tutorial.git
cd applywize-tutorial
```

### Option 2: Use degit to grab a specific lesson

If you want to start from a specific lesson or checkpoint, you can use [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit) to grab just that folder:

```bash
# Get the code for a specific lesson (e.g., end of lesson 3)
npx degit redwoodjs/applywize-tutorial/end-of-3 my-applywize-app

# Navigate to your new project
cd my-applywize-app

# Install dependencies
pnpm install
```

This is particularly useful if you want to:

- Skip ahead to a specific part of the tutorial
- Start from a clean checkpoint if you ran into issues
- Compare your code with a working version

After setting up your project, follow the instructions in the tutorial documentation available at [docs.redwoodjs.com/tutorials/full-stack-app](https://docs.redwoodjs.com/tutorials/full-stack-app)
